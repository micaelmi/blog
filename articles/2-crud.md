# üõ†Ô∏è How to Build Routes in a Node.js API with Fastify and Prisma

Continuing from the previous post [üöÄ How to Set Up a Node.js API with Fastify and Prisma](https://dev.to/micaelmi/setting-up-a-nodejs-api-90j), let's now code our first route.

## Setting Up the Prisma Client

First, we need to create a Prisma client that will be used to interact with our database. Inside the `/src/lib` directory, create a file named `prisma.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export const prisma = new PrismaClient();
```

## Organizing Routes

Next, create a folder named `routes` inside `/src`. Within `/routes`, create another folder named `users`, where we'll store all user-related functions.

Our first file inside this folder will be **`create.ts`**. The required imports for this file are:

```ts
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
import type { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { ZodTypeProvider } from "fastify-type-provider-zod";
import z from "zod";
import { prisma } from "../../lib/prisma"; // our newly defined client
```

Apart from `bcrypt`, all our routes will import these core libraries from Fastify, Zod and Prisma.

## Defining the Route

The function definition includes the HTTP route path, some documentation details, and a Zod-typed schema for input validation. Here‚Äôs how it looks:

```ts
export async function createAccount(app: FastifyInstance) {
  app.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>().post(
    "/users",
    {
      schema: {
        summary: "Create account",
        tags: ["users"],
        body: z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          username: z.string().min(4),
          email: z.string().email(),
          password: z.string().min(8).max(32),
          bio: z.string().optional(),
        }),
      },
    },
    async (request, reply) => {
      // The next part will be placed here
    }
  );
}
```

Zod provides powerful tools for defining validation rules, ensuring our API only accepts correctly formatted data.

## Implementing the Route Logic

Inside the function, we need to retrieve the request data, hash the password, and store the user in the database:

```ts
const { name, username, email, password, bio } = request.body;

const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name,
    username,
    email,
    password: hashedPassword,
    bio,
  },
});

return reply.status(201).send({ userId: user.id });
```

## Registering the Route in the Server

Now that our route is created, we need to import it into `server.ts` so it can be used.

At the beginning of the `server.ts` file, add:

```ts
import { createAccount } from "./routes/users/create";
```

Then, register the route before the `app.listen` call:

```ts
app.register(createAccount);
```

Now, reload the [Swagger page](http://localhost:3333/docs) and the route should be automatically indexed. Besides the documentation, you can also test your route by clicking on the **"Try out"** button and editing the body. If you followed the steps correctly, your route should be working!

## Building the Route to List Users

To list all registered users, create a new file named `list.ts` inside the `/src/routes/users` folder and add the following code:

```ts
import type { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { ZodTypeProvider } from "fastify-type-provider-zod";
import { prisma } from "../../lib/prisma";

export async function listAllUsers(app: FastifyInstance) {
  app.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>().get(
    "/users",
    {
      schema: {
        summary: "List all the registered users",
        tags: ["users"],
      },
    },
    async (request, reply) => {
      const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
        select: {
          id: true,
          name: true,
          username: true,
          email: true,
          bio: true,
          createdAt: true,
        },
      });
      return reply.send({ users });
    }
  );
}
```

> **Note:**  
> The schema here is similar to the one for creating an account, but simpler. We use Prisma‚Äôs `findMany()` method with the `select` option to retrieve only specific fields from the database. You can adjust this to filter or format data as needed.

Register this route in your `server.ts` and test it on the Swagger UI.

## Updating a User

Next, create a file named `update.ts` in the same folder (`/src/routes/users`) with the following code:

```ts
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
import type { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { ZodTypeProvider } from "fastify-type-provider-zod";
import z from "zod";
import { prisma } from "../../lib/prisma";

export async function updateUser(app: FastifyInstance) {
  app.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>().put(
    "/users/:userId",
    {
      schema: {
        summary: "Update user",
        tags: ["users"],
        params: z.object({
          userId: z.string().uuid(),
        }),
        body: z.object({
          name: z.string().optional(),
          username: z.string().min(4).optional(),
          email: z.string().email().optional(),
          password: z.string().min(8).max(32).optional(),
          bio: z.string().optional(),
        }),
      },
    },
    async (request, reply) => {
      const { userId } = request.params;
      let { password } = request.body;

      if (password) {
        password = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
      }
      const user = await prisma.user.update({
        where: { id: userId },
        data: {
          ...request.body,
          password, // will be undefined if not provided
        },
      });

      return reply.status(200).send({ userId: user.id });
    }
  );
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **HTTP Method & URL Params:**  
   We use the PUT method and include a URL parameter (`:userId`), which is validated by Zod in the `params` schema.
2. **Optional Fields:**  
   All fields in the body are optional since the user might update only a subset of the fields.
3. **Password Encryption:**  
   If a new password is provided, it is hashed before updating the record.
4. **Spread Operator:**  
   The spread operator (`...request.body`) is used to pass all the fields, with the exception of password which is handled separately.

Register this route in your `server.ts` and test it via Swagger.

## Deleting a User

Finally, to complete the CRUD operations, create a file named `delete.ts` in the `/src/routes/users` folder with the following code:

```ts
import type { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { ZodTypeProvider } from "fastify-type-provider-zod";
import { prisma } from "../../lib/prisma";
import z from "zod";

export async function deleteUser(app: FastifyInstance) {
  app.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>().delete(
    "/users/:userId",
    {
      schema: {
        summary: "Delete user by id",
        tags: ["users"],
        params: z.object({
          userId: z.string().uuid(),
        }),
      },
    },
    async (request, reply) => {
      const { userId } = request.params;
      const user = await prisma.user.delete({
        where: { id: userId },
      });

      return reply.send({ user });
    }
  );
}
```

> **Note:**  
> This route follows the same pattern as the others‚Äîthe only difference being the HTTP DELETE method. Register it in your server and test it on Swagger.

## Improving the Imports with a Route Index File

As your `server.ts` file grows, importing every route individually can make it look messy. To improve organization, create an `index.ts` file inside the `/src/routes/users` folder:

```ts
import type { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { ZodTypeProvider } from "fastify-type-provider-zod";
import { createAccount } from "./create";
import { listAllUsers } from "./list";
import { updateUser } from "./update";
import { deleteUser } from "./delete";

export async function userRoutes(app: FastifyInstance) {
  const typedApp = app.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>();
  typedApp.register(createAccount);
  typedApp.register(listAllUsers);
  typedApp.register(updateUser);
  typedApp.register(deleteUser);
}
```

Now, in your `server.ts`, instead of registering each route separately, import and register the consolidated `userRoutes` function:

```ts
import { userRoutes } from "./routes/users";

app.register(userRoutes);
```

This setup helps keep your code organized and your `server.ts` file clean.

---

With all these routes in place and registered, your API now supports creating, listing, updating, and deleting users. Test all the routes via the Swagger UI at [http://localhost:3333/docs](http://localhost:3333/docs).
