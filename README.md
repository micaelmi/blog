# 📒 Blog by Micael

Welcome to the repository for **Blog by Micael**, where thoughtful technology insights meet real-world coding challenges. This blog is dedicated to exploring modern technologies and sharing my development journey in building scalable systems. My posts are published on [dev.to](https://dev.to/micaelmi) and document the process behind creating robust APIs and user interfaces.

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the complete codebase for my blog. It covers both the backend and frontend aspects, demonstrating the tools and methodologies I use to build and maintain this project.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Backend
- **Docker** 🐳: Containerization to ensure consistent environments.
- **Node.js** ⚙️: The backbone of our server-side logic.
- **Fastify** ⚡: A high-performance web framework for building APIs.
- **Prisma** 🧩: A type-safe ORM for streamlined database operations.
- **Postgres** 🐘: A powerful, open-source relational database.
- **JWT** 🔑: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.

### 🎨 Frontend
- **Next.js** ⏩: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS** 💨: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **shadcn** 🎨: A modern component library for building beautiful UIs.

## 🔍 How It Works

This repository serves as both a platform for publishing technology articles and a live example of the tools and practices I use in my projects. Here you will find:
- **Backend Code:** APIs built with Fastify and Prisma, containerized with Docker, and secured with JWT authentication.
- **Frontend Code:** A modern, responsive interface developed using Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with shadcn components.
